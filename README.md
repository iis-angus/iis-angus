# Angus Chen's Github Page

**Hello there!** I'm an <img src=images/UChicago_Shield_2Color_Maroon_WhiteBorder_RGB.png width=13, height=15> University of Chicago 28' student majoring in CS+Math. I enjoy everything CS from the software engineering to the data science to (especially) the "mathy fun"! I'm most experienced in **Python** and **C++**, though I've worked with all sorts of code from **Java** to **HTML** and **Javascript**.
